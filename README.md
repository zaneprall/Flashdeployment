# Flashdeployment

flashdeployment is a flash drive based installer batch file I wrote for a company without a WSUS server or AD. 
The primary goal of this project was to standardize and shorten new installation procedures.

This is a redacted version used as a coding example.
This software is primarily nonfunctional without the necessary installfiles folder.
